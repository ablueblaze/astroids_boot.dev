>A game that originated during a course for Boot.dev(Awsome course BTWs!)

Currently in active development. For notes please check the "development_notes" directory.

Here are some of the ways I plan to expand the game(Not in order):
- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
- Add assets to the game as apposing aliens
- Add a local multiplayer function
- Add a online multiplayer function
- Add a load screen
